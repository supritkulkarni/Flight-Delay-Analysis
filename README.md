# Flight-Delay-Analysis
Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the data to identify the causes of flight delays • Help airport security to understand the effect of weather conditions and other factors on flight delays

**Problem Statement**
Airport arrival performance and other events are affected by weather, which may
result in delays or capacity constraints. Almost half of all airport traffic delays are
caused by adverse weather conditions. These uncertainties during airport
operations can result in significant delays and inconvenience to passengers.
Therefore, the airport authority wants to analyze the flights that are delayed and
the effect of weather on the delays.
You have been assigned to visualize the data with the help of histograms, scatter
plots, box plots, and pie charts and understand the effect of weather conditions
and other factors on flight delays.
